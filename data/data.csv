My Terror Dream,Mark Adams,night-terror,2023-08-12,"I used to sleep walk when I was younger (so I was told by my parents), I would also occasionally have lucid dreams from about the age of six but what sticks in my mind the most was my first night terror (if you can call it that). When I ""woke up"" there was an old man at the end of my bed and since I was scared of the dark - so always slept with the light on, I know it wasn't just a trick of the eye. The thing about night terrors is that whatever you see, you're instantly overwhelmed with a sense of pure terror (guess thats why they call them that haha) therefore, an old man might sound pretty harmless but it freaked me the fuck out plus he was almost up to my ceiling in height. Crying/screaming my dad came rushing in and stood right next to him and I said something along the lines of ""he's right next to you"". Fair to say ,being a believer in the paranormal, this freaked him out as he later explained when I got older. The old man had an envelope in his hand and was trying to hand me it, but I missed mentioning this part to my dad as the night terror started to fade away. My dad and I still joke that It could have been the winning lottery numbers since I told him about this part last year."
